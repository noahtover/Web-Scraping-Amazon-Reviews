# Web-Scraping-Amazon-Reviews
In this project, I will scrape Amazon reviews for Monster Beverage Corp's products. Then, I will use this data to determine if its growth has any predictive value for quarterly revenue reports. I believe that reviews could provide insight into a companies well being because it taps into the growth of new customers. As people begin to buy Monster's products, they may leave a review.
